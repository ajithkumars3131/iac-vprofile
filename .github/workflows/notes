Workflow Triggers
Push Events: Runs when changes are pushed to main or stage branches, specifically targeting Terraform files (terraform/**).

Pull Requests: Executes for pull requests to main, ensuring Terraform modifications are validated before merging.

Environment Variables
AWS Credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY): Stored securely in GitHub secrets for authentication.

Terraform State Storage (BUCKET_TF_STATE): Specifies the S3 bucket used to persist Terraform state.

AWS Configuration (AWS_REGION): Defines the deployment region as us-east-2.

EKS Cluster Reference (EKS_CLUSTER): Sets the target Kubernetes cluster for Terraform provisioning.

Job Execution (terraform)
Runs on ubuntu-latest: Uses a Linux runner for Terraform execution.

Sets Default Shell & Working Directory: Ensures Terraform commands execute correctly within ./terraform.

Steps Breakdown
Checkout Repository: Pulls the source code (actions/checkout@v4).

Setup Terraform: Installs Terraform on the runner (hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2).

Initialize Terraform (terraform init): Configures backend storage using the S3 bucket.

Format Check (terraform fmt -check): Ensures code follows Terraform formatting standards.

Validation (terraform validate): Confirms Terraform configuration correctness.

Plan Execution (terraform plan -no-color -input=false -out planfile): Generates an execution plan for resource changes.

Error Handling (steps.plan.outcome == 'failure' â†’ exit 1): Stops execution if planning fails.
