/*

Deploys an AWS EKS cluster with managed node groups for scalable Kubernetes workloads. ðŸš€ Let me know if you need further details!

*/


/*

This eks_managed_node_groups section in your Terraform code defines and configures AWS EKS managed node groups. Here's what it does:

Creates two managed node groups (node-group-1 & node-group-2) for the EKS cluster.

Assigns instance types (t3.small) to each node group.

Defines auto-scaling parameters:

min_size: Minimum number of nodes.

max_size: Maximum allowed nodes.

desired_size: Initial number of nodes when deployed.

These settings ensure that Kubernetes worker nodes are provisioned efficiently, automatically scaled, and optimized for workload demands within the EKS cluster. ðŸš€
